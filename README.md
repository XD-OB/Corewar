# Corewar

In this project, you will create a virtual “arena” in which programs will fight against one another (the “Champions”). You will also create an assembler to compile those Champions as well as a Champion to show the world that you can create life from coffee.

- What is Corewar?
Corewar is a very peculiar game. It’s about bringing “players” together around a “virtual machine”, which will load some “champions” who will fight against one another with the support of “processes”, with the objective being for these champions to stay “alive”.
